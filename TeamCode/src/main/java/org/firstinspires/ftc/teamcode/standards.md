# Robot Motor/Servo Control Standards
Defines how power manipulates each motor/servo on the robot.

## Drivetrain
- Positive values move motor forwards relative to the robot.
- All positive = go forward

## Shooter System
### FlyWheel
- Positive value will shoot ball out
### Intake/Hopper
- Positive value pulls balls through shooter system (ball go intake in)
### Ball Gate
- Position 0 opens the gate to be parallel to the movement of the balls
- Another position (ex. 0.25) closes the gate to be perpendicular to the movement of the balls

## Partner Park System
- Sending positive power to both viper slides pushes the plate downwards, lifting the robot.
